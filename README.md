# detection-engineering-labs
A collection of hands-on detection engineering labs, Sigma/YARA rules, KQL queries, and security automation scripts. Built to showcase practical threat detection, log analysis, and signature development across SIEM, EDR, and cloud environments.

# 🛡️ detection-engineering-labs

This repository contains hands-on labs, detection rules, and automation examples I’ve built to sharpen my skills in threat detection, EDR log analysis, and SOC automation. It reflects my passion for identifying malicious behavior and writing high-fidelity, actionable detections.
